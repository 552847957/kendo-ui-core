# Height

By default, the Grid has no height and expands to fit all table rows.

To allow for a backwards compatibility, the scrollable MVC wrapper of the Grid [applies a default height of 200px to its scrollable data area](http://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/helpers/grid/configuration#scrolling). To control the height of the widget, specify a static pixel value.

###### Example

    $("#grid").kendoGrid({
        height: 100,
        // other configuration
    });

To set the height of the Grid, use any of the following approaches:

* Apply an inline height style to the `<div>` from which the Grid is initialized.
* Use the `height` property of the widget, which will apply an inline style to the Grid wrapper&mdash;the same as the previous option.
* Use external CSS. For example, use the ID or the `.k-grid` CSS class to apply a height style.

It is advisable to set a height to the Grid only if its scrolling is enabled.

When the height of the Grid is set, it calculates the appropriate height of its scrollable data area, so that the sum of the header rows, filter row, data, footer, and pager is equal to the expected height of the widget. That is why if the height of the Grid is changed through JavaScript after you create the widget,  you need to call the [`resize` method of the Grid]({% slug responsivewebdesign_integration_kendoui %}) afterwards. In this way the Grid recalculates the height of its data area.

In some special scenarios it is possible to set a height style to the scrollable data area of the Grid either by using JavaScript or external CSS, which is a `div.k-grid-content` element. In this case it is not recommended to set height to the Grid.

## Setting Limits to the Height

> **Important**
>
> This approach is not applicable when virtual scrolling is enabled.

It is possible to make the Grid expand and shrink vertically according to the number of its rows and yet within certain limits. To achieve this, apply a minimum and/or maximum height style to the scrollable data area and do not set any height of the Grid. If you use the MVC wrapper of the Grid, make sure you [remove the default data area height](http://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/helpers/grid/configuration#scrolling).

It is also possible to use the `.k-grid` class instead of the `GridID` to target all widget instances.

###### Example

    #GridID .k-grid-content
    {
        min-height: 100px;
        max-height: 400px;
    }

## Auto-Resizing the Grid

> **Important**
>
> This section is applicable to scrollable Grids only.

To allow the Grid resize together with its parent, apply a 100% height style to the widget&mdash;[that is, to the `<div class="k-grid">` wrapper of the widget]({% slug widgetwrapperandelement_references_gettingstarted %}). According to the web standards, elements which have their height set in percentage require that the height of their parent is also explicitly set. This requirement applies recursively until either an element with a pixel height or the `html` element is reached. Elements that are 100% high cannot have margins, paddings, borders, or sibling elements. That is why you have to remove the default border of the Grid as well.

Then, make sure that the inner layout of the Grid adapts to changes in the height of the `<div>` wrapper. If these changes are triggered by the resizing of the browser window, subscribe to the window `resize` event of the browser and execute the [`resize`]({% slug responsivewebdesign_integration_kendoui %}) method of the Grid. The `resize` method measures the height of the Grid `<div>` and adjusts the height of the scrollable data area.

If the Grid is placed inside a Kendo UI Splitter or Kendo UI Window, you do not need to call the `resize` method because these widgets will execute it automatically. Also, it is not necessary to apply the method if you use locked (frozen) columns.

If the vertical space that is available for the Grid depends on a custom resizing of the layout, which is controlled by the user, use a suitable event or method related to the layout changes to execute the `resize` method of the Grid. In this case, call the `resize` method even if you use locked columns.

The `resize` method works for the Kendo UI versions delivered after the Kendo UI Q3 2013 release. For older versions, instead of `resize`, use the following approach which practically functions in the same way.

For more information, refer to the article on [how to resize the Grid when the window is resized]({% slug howto_resize_whenthe_windowis_resized_grid %}).

###### Example

    $(window).resize(function() {
        var gridElement = $("#GridID"),
            newHeight = gridElement.innerHeight(),
            otherElements = gridElement.children().not(".k-grid-content"),
            otherElementsHeight = 0;

        otherElements.each(function(){
            otherElementsHeight += $(this).outerHeight();
        });

        gridElement.children(".k-grid-content").height(newHeight - otherElementsHeight);
    });


## Configuring the Loading Indicator

Internally, the Grid uses the [`kendo.ui.progress`](/api/javascript/ui/ui/methods/progress) method to display a loading overlay during remote `read` requests.

If scrolling is disabled, the overlay is displayed over the whole Grid. If scrolling is enabled, the overlay is displayed over the scrollable data area. If scrolling is enabled and the Grid has no set height, the data area will initially have a zero height, which will make the loading overlay invisible during the first remote request. To visualize the loading overlay, use either of the following approaches:

* Set the height of the Grid, or
* Apply the `min-height` style to the `div.k-grid-content` element.

For more information, refer to the [the example of setting the height within certain limits](#setting-limits-to-the-height).
