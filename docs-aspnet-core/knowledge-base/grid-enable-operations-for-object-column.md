## Environment

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Product</td>
  <td>Progress Kendo UI Grid for ASP.NET Core</td>
 </tr>
</table>


## Description

I need an example of how to enable sorting, filtering and grouping for a column in the Grid HTML helper, which holds complex object values.

## Solution

[The following project](https://github.com/telerik/aspnet-core-examples/tree/master/grid/enable-operations-for-object-column) demonstrates how to enable sorting, filtering and grouping in Kendo UI Grid for ASP.NET Core, when a column in the widget represents complex object values.
