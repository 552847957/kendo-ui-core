# Image Browser

By default, the `Insert Image` tool opens a simple dialog that allows you to type in or paste the URL of an image and, optionally, specify a tooltip.

The Editor also supports another way of picking an image by browsing a list of predefined files and directories. Uploading new images is also supported.

## Configuration

To retrieve and upload the files and directories, the image browser needs a server-side implementation.

The image browser tool can be configured through the [`ImageBrowser()`](/api/Kendo.Mvc.UI.Fluent/EditorBuilder#imagebrowsersystemactionkendomvcuifluenteditorimagebrowsersettingsbuilder) configuration method.

###### Example

```
@(Html.Kendo().Editor()
    .Name("editor")
    .ImageBrowser(imageBrowser => imageBrowser
        .Image("~/Content/UserFiles/Images/{0}")
        .Read("Read", "ImageBrowser")
        .Create("Create", "ImageBrowser")
        .Destroy("Destroy", "ImageBrowser")
        .Upload("Upload", "ImageBrowser")
        .Thumbnail("Thumbnail", "ImageBrowser")
    )
)
```

The following list provides information about the default requests and responses for the `Create()`, `Read()`, `Destroy()`, and `Upload()` operations.

- `Create()`&mdash;Makes a `POST` request for the creation of a directory with the following parameters and does not expect a response.

        { "name": "New folder name", "type": "d", "path": "foo/" }

- `Read()`&mdash;Makes a `POST` request that contains the `path` parameter to specify the path which is browsed and expects a file listing in the following format.

    ```
    [
        { "name": "foo.png", "type": "f", "size": 73289 },
        { "name": "bar.jpg", "type": "f", "size": 15289 },
        ...
    ]
    ```

    Where `name` is the file or directory name, `type` is either an **f** for a file or a **d** for a directory, and `size` is the file size (optional).

- `Destroy()`&mdash;Makes a `POST` request with the following parameters:

    - `name`&mdash;The file or directory to be deleted.
    - `path`&mdash;The directory in which the file or the directory resides.
    - `type`&mdash;Whether a file or a directory is to be deleted (an **f** or a **d**).
    - `size`&mdash;(Optional) The file size, as provided by the `Read()` response.

- `Upload()`&mdash;Makes a `POST` request. The request contains `FormData` containing the upload path, file name and type. Its payload consists of the uploaded file. The expected response is a `file` object in the following format:

    ```
    { "name": "foo.png", "type": "f", "size": 12345 }
    ```

- `Thumbnail()`&mdash;Makes a `GET` request for each individual image in order to display its thumbnail in the explorer window. The single request parameter is the `path` to the image. The service is expected to respond with the image file for the thumbnail.

- `Image()`&mdash;Used by the Editor to generate the `src` attribute of the original image when it is inserted. It results in a `GET` request generated by the browser for each inserted image. The URL can point to a file system or to a service and is parameterized&mdash;the `{0}` placeholder denotes the `path` and `fileName` as received from the `Read()` service.

You can update all of these requests and responses through the [`ImageBrowser()`](/api/Kendo.Mvc.UI.Fluent/EditorBuilder#imagebrowsersystemactionkendomvcuifluenteditorimagebrowsersettingsbuilder) configuration. Each of them exposes more options that you can tweak.
