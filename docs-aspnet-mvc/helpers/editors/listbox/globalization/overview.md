# ListBox Globalization

The globalization process combines the translation of component messages (localization) with adapting them to specific cultures (internationalization and right-to-left support).

The globalization functionality of the ListBox is enabled through:
* [Localization of messages]({% slug localization_listboxhelper_aspnetmvc %})
* [Right-to-left support (demo)](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/listbox/right-to-left-support)

* [Server-Side API](/api/listbox)
